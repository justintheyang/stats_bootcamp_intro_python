    "### What is Python? What is Jupyter lab?\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted, high-level programming language. Python was first released in 1991 by developer Guido Van Rossum. Python is widely used by programmers because of its versatile features and fewer programming codes. Python 3.0, releated in 2008, was a major revision of the language and is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was officially discontinued in 2020: no more improvements will be released for it. Therefore, we will use Python 3 throughout this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Python for developing applications, websites, and analyzing data. Some of Python's advantages: \n",
    "* Python is freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. \n",
    "* Python emphasizes code readability\n",
    "* Python has a large and robust standard library\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter lab](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is an open-source computational notebook that allows you to create and share documents that contain inputs and outputs of an interactive session. Notebook files can serve as a complete computational record of a session, interleaving executable code with explanatory text, mathematics, and representations of resulting objects. The notebook documents are saved with the `.ipynb` extension. Notebooks can be exported to a range of static formats, including HTML, PDF, and LaTeX. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What am I doing? Why?\n",
    "Your basic goal when you're working with data in Jupyter notebooks is to write out a **script** that documents and executes every step of your interaction with your data, via lines of **Python code**. You can then run this code in the **code cell**, either bit by bit (starting from the top, and working your way down) or all at once.  \n",
    "Your script will ultimately include every step of data processing and analysis:  \n",
    "* __Formatting datasets__ (e.g., making new variables based on other variables in your dataset, isolating subsets of your dataset, comparing different datasets, ...)  \n",
    "* __Making plots__   \n",
    "* __Summarising results__ (e.g., finding means, assessing variability and distributions, ...)  \n",
    "* __Running statistical analyses__ (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests, regressions, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your script should also include some notes about what you're doing, for future reference. One of the best ways to do this is by creating a Jupyter notebook document, like this one, where you can include both prose (like this current paragraph) and code. This has so many advantages over other ways of analyzing data!\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have a record for yourself - forever! - for working on analyses over time, quickly analyzing similar new datasets, and reconstructing abandoned projects\n",
    "* You can automate as much of the data processing, analysis, plotting, and even reporting process as you want to, saving you from copying and pasting and making stupid mistakes   \n",
    "* You can easily give your script to other people as a guide for them to understand or help you with your analyses,  build on your findings, reanalyze your data, attempt to replicate your studies, etc.  \n",
    "* You can use version control on your analysis code (e.g., using [github](https://github.com/)),  make your own functions and packages tailored to your own projects and needs, make web apps for visualizing your data. \n"
