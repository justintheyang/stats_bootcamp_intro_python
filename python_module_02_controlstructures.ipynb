For control statements, indentation determines boundaries of blocks of code: code with the same indentation is executed together. For example, in the for loop, the block of codes after the `for` statement needs to be indented. They will be executed together. If the spacing doesn't match exactly, then the code will fail. In general, indentation by 4 spaces (use tab!) is preferred."
